# dotiw ![Ruby](https://github.com/radar/distance_of_time_in_words/workflows/Ruby/badge.svg)

The `dotiw` library that adds `distance_of_time_in_words` to any Ruby project, or overrides the default implementation in Rails with more accurate output.

Do you crave accuracy down to the second? So do I. That's why I made this gem.

## Install

Add to your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem 'dotiw'
```

Run `bundle install`.

### Pure Ruby

```ruby
require 'dotiw'

include DOTIW::Methods
```

### Rails

```ruby
require 'dotiw'

include ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper
include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
include ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper
```

## distance\_of\_time\_in\_words

Take this for a totally kick-ass example:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.year + 2.months + 3.weeks + 4.days + 5.hours + 6.minutes + 7.seconds, true)
=> "1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, 5 hours, 6 minutes, and 7 seconds"
```

Also if one of the measurement is zero it will not output it:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.year + 2.months + 5.hours + 6.minutes + 7.seconds, true)
=> "1 year, 2 months, 4 days, 6 minutes, and 7 seconds"
```

Better than "about 1 year", am I right? Of course I am.

"But Ryan!", you say, "What happens if the time is only in seconds but because of the default the seconds aren't shown? Won't it be blank?"
"No!" I triumphantly reply:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.second, false)
=> "1 second"
```

It also supports numeric arguments like the original Rails version:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(0, 150)
=> "2 minutes and 30 seconds"
```

as an alternative to:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 2.5.minutes)
=> "2 minutes and 30 seconds"
```

This is useful if you're just interested in "stringifying" the length of time. Alternatively, you can use the `#distance_of_time` helper as described [below](#distance\_of\_time).

The third argument for this method is whether or not to include seconds. By default this is `false` (because in Rails' `distance_of_time_in_words` it is), you can turn it on though by passing `true` as the third argument:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.year + 1.second, true)
=> "1 year, and 1 second"
```

Yes this could just be merged into the options hash but I'm leaving it here to ensure "backwards-compatibility", because that's just an insanely radical thing to do. \m/

Alternatively this can be included in the options hash as `include_seconds: true` removing this argument altogether.

The last argument is an optional options hash that can be used to manipulate behavior and (which uses `to_sentence`).

Don't like having to pass in `Time.now` all the time? Then use `time_ago_in_words` or `distance_of_time_in_words_to_now` which also will *rock your
world*:

```ruby
>> time_ago_in_words(Time.now + 3.days + 1.second)
=> "3 days, and 1 second"

>> distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(Time.now + 3.days + 1.second)
=> "3 days, and 1 second"
```

Oh, and did I mention it supports I18n? Oh yeah. Rock on!

### Options

#### :locale

You can pass in a locale and it'll output it in whatever language you want (provided you have translations, otherwise it'll default to your app's default locale (the `config.i18n.default_locale` you have set in `/config/application.rb`):

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.minute, false, locale: :es)
=> "1 minuto"
```

This will also be passed to `to_sentence`.

#### :vague

Specify this if you want it to use the old `distance_of_time_in_words`. The value can be anything except `nil` or `false`.

#### :include_seconds

As described above this option is the equivalent to the third argument whether to include seconds.

#### :accumulate_on

Specifies the maximum output unit which will accumulate all the surplus. Say you set it to seconds and your time difference is of 2 minutes then the output would be 120 seconds.

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 2.hours + 70.seconds, true, accumulate_on: :minutes)
=> "121 minutes and 10 seconds"
```

#### :only

Only want a specific measurement of time? No problem!

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute, false, only: :minutes)
=> "1 minute"
```

You only want some? No problem too!

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.day + 1.minute, false, only: [:minutes, :hours])
=> "1 hour and 1 minute"
```

#### :except

Don't want a measurement of time? No problem!

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute, false, except: :minutes)
=> "1 hour"
```

Culling a whole group of measurements of time:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.day + 1.minute, false, except: [:minutes, :hours])
=> "1 day"
```

#### :highest\_measure\_only

> **Deprecated**. Use `highest_measures: 1` instead.

For times when Rails `distance_of_time_in_words` is not precise enough and `DOTIW` is too precise. For instance, if you only want to know the highest time part (measure) that elapsed between two dates.

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute + 1.second, true, highest_measure_only: true)
=> "1 hour"
```

Notice how minutes and seconds were removed from the output. Another example:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.minute + 1.second, true, highest_measure_only: true)
=> "1 minute"
```

Minutes are the highest measure, so seconds were discarded from the output.

#### :highest\_measures

When you want variable precision from `DOTIW`:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute + 1.second, true, highest_measures: 2)
=> "1 hour and 1 minute"
```

You can also specify what to do with the extra time with the `remainder` option:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute + 1.second, true, highest_measures: { max: 2, remainder: :ceiling })
=> "1 hour and 2 minutes"
```

Valid options for `remainder` are `:floor` (default), `:ceiling` and `:round`. Note that `:round` is best-effort and makes some simplifying assumptions:

```ruby
# Only the next-largest unit is examined, which can unexpectedly round down in some situations.
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.week + 3.days + 23.hours, true, highest_measures: { remainder: :round })
=> "1 week"
# The variability of some measures (like months) is ignored and the shortest duration of that measure is used.
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.month + 14.days, true, highest_measures: { remainder: :round })
=> "2 months"
```

#### :words_connector

This is an option for `to_sentence`, defaults to ', '.

Using something other than a comma:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute + 1.second, true, words_connector: ' - ')
=> "1 hour - 1 minute, and 1 second"
```

#### :two\_words\_connector

This is an option for `to_sentence`, defaults to ' and '.

Using something other than 'and':

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute, true, two_words_connector: ' plus ')
=> "1 hour plus 1 minute"
```

#### :last\_word\_connector

This is an option for `to_sentence`, defaults to ', and '.

Using something other than ', and':

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 1.hour + 1.minute + 1.second, true, last_word_connector: ', finally ')
=> "1 hour, 1 minute, finally 1 second"
```

## distance\_of\_time

If you have simply a number of seconds you can get the "stringified" version of this by using `distance_of_time`:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time(300)
=> "5 minutes"
```

## distance\_of\_time\_in\_words\_hash

Don't like any format you're given? That's cool too! Here, have an indifferent hash version:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words_hash(Time.now, Time.now + 1.year + 2.months + 3.weeks + 4.days + 5.hours + 6.minutes + 7.seconds)
=> { days: 4, weeks: 3, seconds: 7, minutes: 6, years: 1, hours: 5, months: 2 }
```

Indifferent means that you can access all keys by their `String` or `Symbol` version.

## distance\_of\_time\_in\_percent

This method is only available with Rails ActionView.

If you want to calculate a distance of time in percent, use `distance_of_time_in_percent`. The first argument is the beginning time, the second argument the "current" time and the third argument is the end time.

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_percent("04-12-2009".to_time, "29-01-2010".to_time, "04-12-2010".to_time)
=> '15%'
```

This method takes the same options as [`number_with_precision`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper.html#method-i-number_with_precision).

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_percent("04-12-2009".to_time, "29-01-2010".to_time, "04-12-2010".to_time, precision: 1)
=> '15.3%'
```

## :compact

Pressed for space? Try `compact: true`.

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 2.year + 1.day + 1.second, compact: true)
=> "2y1d"
```

Pairs well with `words_connector`, `last_word_connector`, and `two_words_connector` if you can spare just a little more room:

```ruby
>> distance_of_time_in_words(Time.now, Time.now + 5.years + 1.day + 23.seconds, words_connector: " ", last_word_connector: " ", two_words_connector: " ", compact: true)
=> "5y 1d 23s"
```
